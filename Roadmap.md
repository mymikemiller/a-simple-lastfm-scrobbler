## Testing ##

  * Unit tests
  * Refactor for easier unit testing

## More apps ##

  * Convince app-makers to broadcast intents about their music-playing

## Some bigger features ##

  * More "scrobbling destinations" - websites, logfiles, xml, custom-api, etc. to send scrobbles to. This will require a major rewrite/refactoring, unit-tests should probably be written first.

## General ##

  * Refactor for cleaner code


This is what I can think of right now.
