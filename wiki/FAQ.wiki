=== What is Last.fm? ===

A site for music discovery, exploration, socialization, etc. And you can listen to music too!

Visit [http://www.last.fm Last.fm], or see their [http://www.last.fm/help/faq FAQ].

=== Is this a music player? ===

No, this is a scrobbler, which means that it submits information to Last.fm on what music you listen to. Then you can view your listening history and other statistics (plus much, much more) on your Last.fm profile page.

=== What's new in version XX? ===

See [http://a-simple-lastfm-scrobbler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/a_simple_lastfm_scrobbler/assets/changelog.txt this] for a list of changes.

=== Please support app YY ===

I'm always looking for new apps to support, but almost always it requires some work on their end as well. Be assured though, the list of supported apps will grow. (If you are a developer, see [http://code.google.com/p/a-simple-lastfm-scrobbler/wiki/Developers this]).

But if there is no ticket for app YY [http://code.google.com/p/a-simple-lastfm-scrobbler/issues/list here], email me or create a ticket yourself and I'll get right on it.

=== Why don't you add support for !TuneWiki? ===

!TuneWiki already has built in support for scrobbling. In !TuneWiki, go to Menu -> Settings -> Last.fm Account Settings.

=== Why won't my track scrobble if put on repeat? (Android Music/HTC Hero) ===

This is an unfortunate bug/reality. As Android Music and HTC Hero currently work, if you put a single track on repeat, it won't scrobble as many times as is correct. This is because AM / HTCH doesn't submit enough information to external apps.

If you have more than one track in your repeated playlist, scrobbling will be fine.

As soon as I find a way to fix this, I will.

=== What is Libre.fm? ===

A new website, similar in ambition to Last.fm.

Visit [http://libre.fm Libre.fm].

=== What does 'Also on playlist finish' in the options screen mean? ===

It means that if checked SLS will submit your scrobles when you've listened to the last track in a playlist.

Currently this only works for Android Music/HTC Hero.

=== What is Scrobble Droid? ===

Scrobble Droid is an app for Android similar to Simple Last.fm Scrobbler.

*It is strongly recommended not to have both Scrobble Droid and Simple Last.fm Scrobbler installed at the same time.*

=== What does "Scrobble Droid Apps" mean? ===

"Scrobble Droid Apps" mean all apps who have implemented support for the [http://code.google.com/p/scrobbledroid/wiki/DeveloperAPI Scrobble Droid API], i.e. that can scrobble through Scrobble Droid. So by enabling this in the Supported Apps section, you can scrobble songs played in for instance [http://sites.google.com/site/eternalsandbox/Home/meridian-video-player Meridian Player] and [http://abrantix.org/rockon.php RockOn].
