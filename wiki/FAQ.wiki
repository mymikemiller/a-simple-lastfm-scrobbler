== Questions ==

=== 1: What is Last.fm? ===

Visit [http://www.last.fm Last.fm], or see their [http://www.last.fm/help/faq FAQ].

=== 2: Is this a music player? ===

No, this is a scrobbler, which means that it submits information to Last.fm on what music you listen to. Then you can view your listening history and other statistics (plus much, much more) on your Last.fm profile page.

=== 3: What's new in version XX? ===

See [http://a-simple-lastfm-scrobbler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/a_simple_lastfm_scrobbler/assets/changelog.txt this] for a list of changes.

=== 4: Please support app YY ===

I'm always looking for new apps to support, but almost always it requires some work on their end as well. Be assured though, the list of supported apps will grow. (If you are a developer, see [http://code.google.com/p/a-simple-lastfm-scrobbler/wiki/Developers this]).

=== 5: Why don't you add support for Tune-Wiki? ===

Tune-Wiki already has built in support for scrobbling. In Tune-Wiki, go to Menu -> Settings -> Last.fm Account Settings.
