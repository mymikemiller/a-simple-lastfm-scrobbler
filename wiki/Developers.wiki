#summary How other applications can scrobble music through Simple Last.fm Scrobbler
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Any application can easily scrobble their music through A Simple Last.fm Scrobbler. It is just to send certain broadcasts with the appropriate track information, and SLS will do the rest.

You just have to implement the behavior below, and then send a mail to [mailto:simple.lfm.scrobbler@gmail.com simple.lfm.scrobbler@gmail.com] and tell me about it.

= Details =

The broadcast actions are:

|| PLAYBACKSTARTED || "com.example.musicapp.notify.playbackstarted" || When a track starts playing ||
|| PLAYBACKCOMPLETE || "com.example.musicapp.notify.playbackcomplete" || When a track has finished playing ||

Replace "com.example.musicapp" with your app's package name.

It is not necessary to broadcast PLAYBACKCOMPLETE for a track to scrobble, if a new track starts playing and PLAYSTATECHANGED is broadcast.

= Examples = 
This sends a broadcast that Chris Cornell's song "You Know My Name" has started playing, and will scrobble any previously playing tracks:

{{{
Intent bCast = new Intent(PLAYBACKSTARTED);
bCast.putExtra("artist", "Chris Cornell");
bCast.putExtra("album", "Casino Royale");
bCast.putExtra("track", "You Know My Name");
bCast.putExtra("duration", 244);
sendBroadcast(bCast);
}}}

And this says that James Marster's song "Looking At You" has finished playing and should be scrobbled: 

{{{
Intent bCast = new Intent(PLAYBACKCOMPLETE);
bCast.putExtra("artist", "James Marster");
bCast.putExtra("album", "Like A Waterfall");
bCast.putExtra("track", "Looking At You");
bCast.putExtra("duration", 175);
sendBroadcast(bCast);
}}}

= Custom Broadcasts =

If you already broadcast your own intents, tell me about them and I'll see if I can work them into SLS.
